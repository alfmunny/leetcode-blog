Problem Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal. Note: Each of the array element will not exceed 100. The array size will not exceed 200. Example 1: Input: [1, 5, 11, 5] Output: true Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11]. Example 2: Input: [1, 2, 3, 5] Output: false Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.</description>

Problem Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0&amp;#39;s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. Example: Input: [0,1,0,3,12] Output: [1,3,12,0,0] Note: You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array. Minimize the total number of operations. Solution Two pointers.
One pointer is for the start of 0.
One pointer keeps going forward.

      <description>leetcode
Problem Write an algorithm to determine if a number is &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34;. A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.</description>

Problem Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions. Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4] Output: 6 Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.</description>

You may complete as many transactions as you like Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 7 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.</description>

Problem Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one. Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at start index of the array. When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], check if you can reach to any index with value 0. Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time. Example 1: Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5 Output: true Explanation: All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are: index 5 -&amp;gt; index 4 -&amp;gt; index 1 -&amp;gt; index 3 index 5 -&amp;gt; index 6 -&amp;gt; index 4 -&amp;gt; index 1 -&amp;gt; index 3 Example 2: Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0 Output: true Explanation: One possible way to reach at index 3 with value 0 is: index 0 -&amp;gt; index 4 -&amp;gt; index 1 -&amp;gt; index 3 Example 3: Input: arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2 Output: false Explanation: There is no way to reach at index 1 with value 0.</description>

Problem Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps. Example: Input: [2,3,1,1,4] Output: 2 Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.</description>

Problem Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. Example: Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4], Output: 6 Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle. Notes Dynamic programming problem.
Use nums[i] always store the maximum sum.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). Note: You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation. Example 1: Given input matrix = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ], rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes: [ [7,4,1], [8,5,2], [9,6,3] ] Example 2: Given input matrix = [ [ 5, 1, 9,11], [ 2, 4, 8,10], [13, 3, 6, 7], [15,14,12,16] ], rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes: [ [15,13, 2, 5], [14, 3, 4, 1], [12, 6, 8, 9], [16, 7,10,11] ] Notes Naive solution, to do it one by one.</description>

Recursion Iterative version:
Start from empty array [[]]. Step 1: Take 1 into consideration, and add 1 to existing array [[], [1]] Step 2: Take 2 into consideration, and add 2 to existing array [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]] Step 3: Take 3 into consideration, and add 3 to existing array [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]] DFS version:</description>

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively. Note: You are not suppose to use the library&amp;#39;s sort function for this problem. Example: Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0] Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2] Follow up: A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.</description>
