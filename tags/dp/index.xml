Problem Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for &amp;#39;.&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;*&amp;#39;. &amp;#39;.&amp;#39; Matches any single character. &amp;#39;*&amp;#39; Matches zero or more of the preceding element. The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial). Note: s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z. p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.</description>

Problem  Given a circular array C of integers represented by A, find the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray of C.
Here, a circular array means the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array. (Formally, C[i] = A[i] when 0 &amp;lt;= i &amp;lt; A.length, and C[i+A.length] = C[i] when i &amp;gt;= 0.)
Also, a subarray may only include each element of the fixed buffer A at most once.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product. Example 1: Input: [2,3,-2,4] Output: 6 Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6. Example 2: Input: [-2,0,-1] Output: 0 Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray. Notes DP problem:
  States: We have to know two previous states to deduct the current max product:</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1. Example 1: Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11 Output: 3 Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1 Example 2: Input: coins = [2], amount = 3 Output: -1 Note: You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence. Example: Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18] Output: 4 Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. Note: There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length. Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity. Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity? Solution DP problem.</description>

Problem You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.</description>

Problem Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions. Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [2,4,1], k = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.</description>

Problem Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions. Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4] Output: 6 Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.</description>

Problem The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N &amp;gt; 1. Given N, calculate F(N). Example 1: Input: 2 Output: 1 Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.</description>

Problem Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. Example: Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4], Output: 6 Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle. Notes Dynamic programming problem.
Use nums[i] always store the maximum sum.</description>

Problem Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time. Example: Input: [ [1,3,1], [1,5,1], [4,2,1] ] Output: 7 Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
