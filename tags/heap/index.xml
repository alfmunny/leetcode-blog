      <description>leetcode
Problem Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value. For example, [2,3,4], the median is 3 [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 Design a data structure that supports the following two operations: void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix. Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element. Example: matrix = [ [ 1, 5, 9], [10, 11, 13], [12, 13, 15] ], k = 8, return 13. Solution Solution 1: Heap with marker Maintain a heap, pop the first one, and push the right one and lower one into the heap.</description>

      <title>973 - K Closest Points to Origin</title>

      <description>leetcode
Problem We have a list of points on the plane. Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0). (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.) You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.) Example 1: Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1 Output: [[-2,2]] Explanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight. Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x &amp;lt;= y. The result of this smash is: If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed; If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.</description>
