      <description>leetcode
Problem We have a list of points on the plane. Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0). (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.) You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.) Example 1: Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1 Output: [[-2,2]] Explanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight. Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x &amp;lt;= y. The result of this smash is: If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed; If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.</description>
