Problem You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition: struct Node { int val; Node *left; Node *right; Node *next; } Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL. Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). Note: You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation. Example 1: Given input matrix = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ], rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes: [ [7,4,1], [8,5,2], [9,6,3] ] Example 2: Given input matrix = [ [ 5, 1, 9,11], [ 2, 4, 8,10], [13, 3, 6, 7], [15,14,12,16] ], rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes: [ [15,13, 2, 5], [14, 3, 4, 1], [12, 6, 8, 9], [16, 7,10,11] ] Notes Naive solution, to do it one by one.</description>

      <description>Problem Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer. Example 1: Input: [1,2,0] Output: 3 Example 2: Input: [3,4,-1,1] Output: 2 Example 3: Input: [7,8,9,11,12] Output: 1 Note: Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space. Notes Run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space
  Say the length of the array is l, the number must be in 1&amp;hellip;l+1 (also l possible numbers)</description>
