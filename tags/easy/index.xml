      <description>leetcode
Problem Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
Example:
Input: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Input: [3,2,3] Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2] Output: 2

      <description>leetcode
Problem You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where shift[i] = [direction, amount]: direction can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift). amount is the amount by which string s is to be shifted. A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end. Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.</description>

Problem We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight. Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x &amp;lt;= y. The result of this smash is: If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed; If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. Example: Given a binary tree 1 / \ 2 3 / \ 4 5 Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].</description>

Problem Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0&amp;#39;s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. Example: Input: [0,1,0,3,12] Output: [1,3,12,0,0] Note: You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array. Minimize the total number of operations. Solution Two pointers.

      <description>leetcode
Problem Write an algorithm to determine if a number is &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34;. A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.</description>

Problem Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 7 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.</description>

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one. Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.</description>

Problem Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. Example: Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4], Output: 6 Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle. Notes Dynamic programming problem.
Use nums[i] always store the maximum sum.</description>
