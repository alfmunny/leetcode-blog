Problem Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 7 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.</description>

Problem Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one. Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps. Example: Input: [2,3,1,1,4] Output: 2 Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N &amp;gt; 1. Given N, calculate F(N). Example 1: Input: 2 Output: 1 Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top? Note: Given n will be a positive integer. Example 1: Input: 2 Output: 2 Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top. 1. 1 step + 1 step 2. 2 steps Example 2: Input: 3 Output: 3 Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. Example: Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4], Output: 6 Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle. Notes Dynamic programming problem.
Use nums[i] always store the maximum sum.</description>
