Problem #+begin_qoute You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.
Example 1:
Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8] Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11] Output: 10
#+end_quote
Solution class Solution: def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums): lo = 0 hi = len(nums) - 1 while lo &amp;lt; hi: mid = (lo + hi) // 2 if mid == 0: return mid if (mid - lo + 1) % 2 == 0: if nums[mid] == nums[mid - 1]: lo = mid + 1 else: hi = mid - 1 else: if nums[mid] == nums[mid - 1]: hi = mid - 2 else: lo = mid return nums[lo] print(Solution().</description>

Problem You are given K eggs, and you have access to a building with N floors from 1 to N. Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again. You know that there exists a floor F with 0 &amp;lt;= F &amp;lt;= N such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor F will not break.</description>
