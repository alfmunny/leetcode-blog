      <description>leetcode
Problem Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0&amp;#39;s and 1&amp;#39;s, find the largest square containing only 1&amp;#39;s and return its area. Example: Input: 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 Output: 4 Notes DP Problem:
  States:
 position -&amp;gt; [i][j] how many continues 1 in vertical direction -&amp;gt; [i][j][0] how many continues 1 in horizontal direction -&amp;gt; [i][j][1] square value(or the length of the square) -&amp;gt; [i][j][2]  dp[i][j][0 or 1 or 2]</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center). For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric: 1 / \ 2 2 / \ / \ 3 4 4 3 But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not: 1 / \ 2 2 \ \ 3 3 Notes Recursion !
Solution Solution 1: recursive class Solution: def isSymmetric(self, root): if not root: return True return self.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. Example: Input: 1-&amp;gt;2-&amp;gt;4, 1-&amp;gt;3-&amp;gt;4 Output: 1-&amp;gt;1-&amp;gt;2-&amp;gt;3-&amp;gt;4-&amp;gt;4 Notes Recursion is your friend!
Solution Solution 1: Recursive class Solution: def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2): if not l1: return l2 if not l2: return l1 if l1.val &amp;gt; l2.val: l2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next) return l2 else: l1.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. Note: A leaf is a node with no children. Example: Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7], 3 / \ 9 20 / \ 15 7 Notes Recursion is your friend!
Solution class Solution: def maxDepth(self, root): return 1 + max(self.maxDepth(root.right), self.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 7 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.</description>

      <description>leetcode
Problem Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one. Example 1: Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.</description>
